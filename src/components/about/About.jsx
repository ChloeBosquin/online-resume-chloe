                <p>I am a detailed-oriented front-end developer with a passion
                for developing intuitive and well-designed user interfaces.
                As a problem-solving-oriented and extremly curious
                developer, I love improving process to write simpler and
                more efficient code. </p>
                <p>I have a strong ability to multitask,
                always making sure I meet deadlines. I value collaboration
                as I believe solving technical challenges is easier when
                doing it as a team.</p>
